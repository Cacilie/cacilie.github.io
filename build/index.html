I was just searching for something minimalistic, distraction free that allows 
me to write and know how many words I have. 
That's why I created tororu, a progressive web app for writting.</pre>[<a href="https://github.com/Cacilie/tororu" target="_blank"> Repository</a> - <a href="https://cacilie.github.io/tororu/" target="_blank"> App</a> ] </article><article><h2>japiDB</h2><pre>When building tororu text editor, I need a way to persist local data for a web application.
I didn't wanted to build any backend, I wanted to make a simple frontend single page web application 
that people can use to write. Localstorage was there but I wanted to implemented in a escalable,
mantainable way. Thanks why i created japiDB, a library for persistance in the frontend.</pre>[<a href="https://github.com/Cacilie/japidb" target="_blank"> Repository</a> - <a href="https://cacilie.gitbook.io/japidb/" target="_blank"> Docs</a> ] </article></body></html>
