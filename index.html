I was just searching for something minimalistic, distraction free that allows 
me to write and know how many words I have written. 
That's why I created tororu, a progressive web app for writting.</q>[<a href="https://github.com/Cacilie/tororu" target="_blank"> Repository</a> - <a href="https://cacilie.github.io/tororu/" target="_blank"> App</a> ] </article><article><h2>japiDB</h2><q>When building tororu text editor, I need a way to persist local data for a web application.
I didn't wanted to build any backend, I wanted to make a simple frontend single page web application 
that people can use to write. Localstorage was there but I wanted to implemented in a escalable,
mantainable way. That is why i created japiDB, a library for persistance in the frontend.</q>[<a href="https://github.com/Cacilie/japidb" target="_blank"> Repository</a> - <a href="https://cacilie.gitbook.io/japidb/" target="_blank"> Docs</a> ] </article><article><h2>react-minimalist-table</h2><q>A minimalist, plug and ready, react table with interesting features like conditional 
cell styling. The table is fully responsive and easy to implement and also, pretty customisable.</q>[<a href="https://github.com/Cacilie/react-minimalist-table" target="_blank"> Repository</a> - <a href="https://cacilie.gitbook.io/react-minimalist-table/" target="_blank"> Docs</a> ] </article><article><h2>set-theory library</h2><q>This library attempts to create a set of utils to apply set theory on JS/TS. (pun intended).
Currently, Vanilla JS includes the Set Object with some methods to do set operations. 
But this methods stop working properly when the rank of a set is greater than 1.
In other words. Vanilla JS fails when applying the operations to sets that have sets within.
The objective of this library is to provide functions that work with the basic sets 
but also with those sets described above.</q>[<a href="https://github.com/Cacilie/set-theory" target="_blank"> Repository</a><a href="https://jsr.io/@discrete-math/set-theory" target="_blank"> Deno Pkg</a>] </article></body></html>
