			h2 tororu text editor
			pre.
				I like writing, but wasn't feeling really comfortable with any existing writing tool.
				I was just searching for something minimalistic, distraction free that allows 
				me to write and know how many words I have. That's why I created tororu.

			h2 japiDB
			pre.
				When building tororu text editor, I need a way to persist local data for a web application.
				I didn't wanted to build any backend, I wanted to make a simple frontend single page web application 
				that people can use to write. Localstorage was there but I wanted to implemented in a escalable,
				mantainable way. Thanks why i created japiDB, a library for persistance in the frontend.
